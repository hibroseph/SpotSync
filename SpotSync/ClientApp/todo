This is used to keep track of what is currently an issue and what I am working on.

MVP 

5. ISSUE: Initial playlist generated queue is not correct (UpdateSong gets called before the queue is loaded. History is broken)
6. POSSIBLE ISSUE: If spotify is open and playing music, music will play out of that source first (maybe not issue)
